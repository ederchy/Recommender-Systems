Data Cleaning

We will perform several transformations to clean the text so that it is suitable for feature engineering.Below given operations will be applied for cleaning data :

Lower

Tokenize

Stopwords

Lemmatize 

       4.Exploratory Data Analysis

       5.Word Cloud: Word Cloud based on Product Rating

       6.Feature Extraction using NLP Unsupervised Learning 

We need to extract the features from the text and their associated sentiment.

For that, we will be using Topic Modelling.

      7. Sentiment Analysis

We will be performing sentiment analysis using Python Packages.

Opinion Word Polarity Identification

Opinion Sentence Polarity Identification

Modelling using ML Techniques

Training a Text Classification Model using ML Techniques like :
